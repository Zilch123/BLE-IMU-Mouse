# BLE-IMU-Mouse

Initial challege was sorting out the library, getting it along with IMU took 5 hours. Thanks to the french guy for this fucking awesome lib.
There are still two more challenges, to find/code IMU tracking algo. If not map angle using gravity vector in acc. 
The Imu data should be properly mapped to the x, y screen position.
